When encountered with a problem he simply begins flipping his pen around while pacing back and forth and within a few moments he's back at the desk implementing the solution that he worked out in his head. He has vast experience in training and teaching people to program."

Never have I ever seen a person take an entire language or platform they've never even developed in, and within a week (sometimes just a few days), create a full-scale, professional, bug-free application with coding standards for [enter language here] so properly executed. The man himself is AN ENTIRE walking, talking, development team to himself. To say that Sam is something close to a genius, would be an understatement. But not only is he capable of creating full-scale, fully-functioning, professional level applications himself... as a team-mate, he will positively challenge you to become engaged, and to challenge yourself, as well. I haven't worked for/with Sam in years, but I always look back and think about that guy and how amazing he was: as a team mate, a software developer, a teacher, and a friend."
